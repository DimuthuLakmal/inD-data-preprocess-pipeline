# Vision-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Sparse Bipartite Graph Neural Network for Occlusion Inference

## Installation and Quick Start

1. Create a new Python environment or select a pre-existing one. 
   This code is tested with Python 3.8, but is very probably compatible with newer releases of Python.

   If you use Anaconda3, this can be done as follows:
   ```shell 
   conda create --name vstsbgat python=3.8
   conda activate vstsbgat
   ```

2. Install required packages by navigating to the root directory and using
    ```shell 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in README files placed in the preprocessing branch. Once you have the observation data prepared, please edit the `configs/config.yaml` file to set the correct paths to your data.

4. Run the training script:
    ```shell 
    python3 src/train.py
    ```
   
5. Run the evaluation script:
    ```shell 
    python3 src/test.py
    ```
